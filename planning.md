Srs Bot gets: "Fuck light mode all my homies hate light mode delete this already"
LMD (Light Mode Defender) goes: This is anti-light mode propaganda (88% accuracy)
Srs Bot sends: "ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ shut this light's brighter than your future ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤"

# Overall Plan
1. Tag POS
2. Get POS Phrases / Chunk it
3. Take care of the pronouns (pronoun anaphora stuff)
4. Find out which phrases mention light mode
5. Take care of negations
6. Sentiment Analysis every phrase that mentions light mode
7. Return a score
8. ???
9. Discord HQ bows down before the cult, goes to church, and removes dark mode from the app
