# Light Mode Defender (The boring, technical TLDR version)
<a href='https://discord.com/blog/light-theme-redeemed'>This is a story of Light Theme's redemption.</a> So sit back, grab some popcorn üçø, and let's unleash Divine Smite on some heathens. <br />

A NLP Model I'm building from scratch to conduct sentiment analysis on a text and determine its feelings towards light mode. <br />
This is built on Node.js. Some data came from the Penn Treebank and me manually inserting them from Reddit articles.

## Technical Details
Wowza this took almost the entirety of freshman year to make and it's still a WIP <br /><br />
To run **Light Mode Defender**, `git clone` the repo and run `./index,js`. Although I really only intended Light Mode Defender to be a npm package/module I could import to say, srs bot. <br /><br />
To see the logic behind things/planning, go to `./planning.md`.

## Light Mode Defender (The Story) üòé‚öîÔ∏è
<p align="center">
  <b>A long time ago in a Discord server far, far away...</b><br />
  <br />
  <b>Episode I</b> <br />
  <b>The Phantom Darkness</b> <br />
  Turmoil has engulfed the GAMER REPUBLIC. The fate of light mode is in dispute. <br />
  <br />
  Hoping to eradicate sunlight through the power of mass suggestion, the heathenous AXIS OF DARKNESS has unleashed a barrage of <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/04/nobody-understands-the-people-who-use-discords-light-theme/">meme artillary</a> on the small handful of believers.<br />
  <br />
  While the Discord Hypesquad endlessly debates this unalarming chain of events, the Dark Side of the app has secretly dispatched two cladestine agents, armed with bribe money and satanic monstrocities from Ohio, to "settle" the conflict... <br /> <br />

  <br /> 
  <br />
  <b>Episode II</b> <br />
  <b>Attack of the Clones</b> <br />
  There is unrest in the <a href="https://disboard.org/server/714688371401949207">light mode union</a>. Several thousand apps and platforms have declared their intentions to leave the Republic.<br />
  <br />
  This seperatist movement, enabled and dictated by the corrupt <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LightModePatrol/">Light Mode Patrol</a>, has made it difficult for the limited number of believers to survive across the internet. <br />
  <br />
  Justin, a random bozo with a seal profile picture, is returning to the <s>senate</s> (no that doesn't exist, I *am* the senate), to vote on a critical issue of creating an ARMY OF BOTS to assist the overwhelmed fighters...<br /> <br />

  <br /> 
  <br />
  <b>Episode III</b> <br />
  <b>Revenge of the Diff</b> <br />
  WAR! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Dark Lord. <br />
  <br />
  There are only heroes on the light side. Evil is everywhere. In a stunning move, the heathenous wicked mastermind, [name redacted], has swept into the Discord capital and infected srs bot with meoware.<br />
  <br />
  As the dark mode army attempts to flee the crime scene with their brainwashed hostage, a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHpCYFz5qE'>young brave soul lead a desperate mission</a> to find what's left of the light mode union... <br /> <br />

  <br /> 
  <br />
  <b>Episode IV</b> <br />
  <b>A New Hope</b> <br />
  It's a period of total war. Light Mode rebels in Discord HQ, under the cover of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/bf6193/about_light_theme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x">false flag operation</a>, have won their first victory against the evil AXIS OF DARKNESS. <br />
  <br />
  During the battle, rebel spies managed to repurpose secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, a light powerful enough to flashbang and stun the entire virtual realm. <br />
  <br />
  Despite being pursued by the AXIS OF DARKNESS' sinister agents, Kontebulon and the rebels races to summon a <a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1171167852889436160">brighter, better, bolder Light Mode</a> that can save their people and restore freedom in the galaxy... <br /><br />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/71soUDF.png" />
  <br /> 
  <br />
  <b>Episode V</b> <br />
  <b>The Axis Strikes Back</b> <br />
  It's a dark (pun intended) time for the rebellion. Although the Death Star has been unleashed, the Light Mode Patrol have defeated the believers at their <a href="https://i.imgur.com/v2kTabd.png">own game</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7cAOMGU.png">pursued them across the galaxy</a>.<br />
  <br />
  Evading the dreaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFOjkmfHmsc">ban hammer</a>, a group of freedom fighters has established a new secret base on the remote outskirts of Reddit. <br />
  <br />
  The vitamin-D deficient heathens, obsessed with eradicating every trace the light, has dispatched millions of npcs into the far reaches of the internet...<br />
  <br />

  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Episode VI</b> <br />
  <b>Return of the Defender</b> <br />
  Justin has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4TE8CZ5rXs">returned to his home planet of Earth</a> in an attempt to rescue the Discord server from the clutches of Discord HQ's new vile creation: amoled. <br />
  <br />
  Little does the Dark Mode npcs know that the believers have secretly (ok kind of secretly) begun construction on a new bot army even more powerful than the first dreaded Srs Bot.<br />
  <br />
  When completed, LIGHT MODE DEFENDER will spell certain doom for the AXIS OF DARKNESS struggling to defile the powers of the light ...
